Friends are those who make you smile, always open their hearts to you and encourage you to succeed.

Don't wait trouble troubles you.不要等到麻烦来麻烦你。这里trouble先是名词后是动词进行使用。[来源](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1B5411Y719?t=898.8&p=7)

Act Your Shoe Size, Not Your Age

As adults,it seems that we are constantlypursuing happiness, often with mixed results.Yet children appear to have it down to an art-and for themost part they don't need self-help books or therapy.3Instead, they look after their wellbeing instinctively .and usually more effectively than we do as grownupsPerhaps it's time to learn a few lessons from them.

别那么成熟
作为成年人，似乎我们在不断追寻幸福，取得的结果却往往好坏参半。然而孩子们似乎对此驾轻就熟--并且在很大程度上，他们不需要自助书籍或治疗。相反，他们凭本能关照自己的幸福，且成效通常比我们成年人更好。也许是时候向他们学习一些经验了。

Express your emotions
 What does a child do when he's sad?2He3 When he's angry? 4 He shouts. Scared?cries.Probably a bit of both.@As we grow up, we learn tocontrol our emotions so they are manageable and don'tdictate our behaviours, which is in many ways a goodthing. 8But too often we take this process too far andend up suppressing cmotions，especially negative ones9 That's about as effective as brushing dirt under acarpet and can even make us ill. What we need to do isfind a way to acknowledge and cxpress what we feelappropriately，and then-again, like children-move on

表达情绪
孩子在伤心时会做什么呢?他会大哭在他生气的时候呢?他会大叫。害怕的时候呢?大概多少会又哭又闹。在成长过程中，我们学会控制情绪，为的是使其可受控制而不至于支配我们的行为方式，这在许多方面是件好事。但我们常常会将这一步做得太过，并最终压抑情绪，尤其是负面情绪这样做无异于掩耳盗铃，甚至可能让我们生病。我们需要做的是找到一种方式承认并适当地表达我们的感受，然后--还是像孩子一样--继续前行。

 Be easily pleasedllA couple of Christmases ago, my youngeststepdaughter,who was nine years old at the time, got a2 It cost less than aSuperman T-shirt for Christmas.fiver but she was overjoyed,and couldn't stop talkingabout it.3Too often we believe that a new job,biggerhouse or better car will be the magic silver bullet that willallow us to finally be content,but the reality is thesethings have very little lasting impact on our happinesslevels.4 Instead, being grateful for small things everyday is a much better way to improve wellbeing

 知足常乐几年前的圣诞节，我最小的继女(那时九岁)得到了一件超人T恤作为圣诞礼物这件T恤的价格不到五镑，但她欣喜若狂，说起它来没完没了。有太多时候，我们认为一份新工作、一套更大的房子或一辆更好的车会是让我们最终得以满足的神奇良方，但实际情况是这些东西对我们的幸福水平几乎没有持久影响。相反，每天因小事而心怀感激，用这种方法提升幸福感要好得多。

Be silly
Have you ever noticed how much childrenlaugh? If we adults could indulge in a bit of sillinessand giggling，we would reduce the stress hormones inour bodies，increase good hormones like endorphins,improve blood flow to our hearts and even have agreater chance of fighting off infection.3 All of whichwould, of course, have a positive effect on our happiness levels.

犯点儿傻
你曾注意过孩子们是多么爱笑吗?如果我们成年人能够纵情于一点傻气和傻笑那么我们体内的压力激素将会减少,像内啡这样的有益激素将增加，心脏血流量将得以改善，甚至连抵御传染病的概率也会上升。所有这一切显然会对我们的幸福水平产生积极的影响。

Have fun
V The problem with being a grownup is thatthere's an awful lot of serious stuff to deal with--work,mortgage payments， figuring out what to cook fordinner.2But as adults we also have the luxury of beingable to control our own diaries and it's important that weschedule in time to enjoy the things we love.3 Thosethings might be social,sporting,creative or completelyrandom (dancing around the living room,anyone?)--itdoesn't matter,so long as they're enjoyable, and notlikely to have negative side effects, such as drinking toomuch alcohol or going on a wild spending spree if you'reon a tight budget

玩得开心成年人的身份带来的问题在于，有太多严肃的事情需要处理一-工作、按揭付款、决定晚餐该做什么。但作为成年人，我们也拥有“能够把控自己工作日程”这样的奢侈机会，而做好时间安排，享受我们喜欢的事情，这是很有必要的。那些事情可以是有关社交的、运动的、创意的或者完全任意的(在客厅翩翩起舞，有人做过吗?)这没什么大不了的，只要它们令人愉快，且不怎么会产生负面影响，如饮酒过度或在预算紧张的情况下进一步疯狂挥霍

Don't overthink it
V Having said all of the above, it's important toadd that we shouldn't try too hard to be happy2Scientists tell us this can backfire and actually have anegative impact on our wellbeing.3Asthe Chinesephilosopher Chuang Tzu is reported to have said:“Happiness is the absence of striving for happiness.4And in that,once more, we need to look to the exampleof our children,to whom happiness is not a goal but anatural byproduct of the way they live.[522 words]

别想太多
虽如上文所述，但有必要补充说明的是，我们不应该过分追求幸福。科学家告诉我们这可能会适得其反，并且实际上对我们的幸福造成负面影响。正如中国哲学家庄子曾说过的:“无为诚乐。”在这一点上，我们需再次考虑以孩子们为榜样对他们来说，幸福不是目标，而是其生活方式自然而然的额外收获
